A Minecraft plugin based off of many first-person shooters.

This project was started in March 2015 and is no longer in development.

I have started work on a new version of this project that is focusing on reworking certain parts of the plugin and adding in new features.

This project was my first big plugin that I decided to make. I wanted to create something that would go above and beyond what I would normally make. I put extra effort into making a smooth and easy-to-use experience for everyone using it. Lastly, I wanted the plugin to support easy expansion and to be able to take in configuration changes without interrupting any current games going on, or having to restart the server.
